/** Class implementing the Gale-Shapley "stable marriage" Algorithm.
  *
  * @tparam M the type of proposer.
  * @tparam W the type of proposee.
  * @note The algorithm guarantees that all `M` and `W` are matched (i.e., all type `W` agents are acceptable matches
  *       for a type `M` agent and all type `M` agents are acceptable matches for a type `W` agent) and that the
  *       resulting matching will be stable. Furthermore the resulting matching will be optimal for the proposing type
  *       `M` agents.
  *
  *       [[http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall09/papers/dubbinsfreedman.pdf ''Dubins and Freedman (1981)'']]
  *       and [[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/cf51/08ca274bdf762193ffdc8d2b2c95208af1b0.pdf ''Roth (1982)'']]
  *       proved that is a weakly dominant strategy for type `M` agents to submit truthful preferences over type `W`
  *       agents. Type `W` agents, on the other hand, may have incentives to mis-state their true preferences over type
  *       `M` agents.
  * @see For a non-mathematical description of the algorithm see
